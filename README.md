## What it does

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
Challenges we ran into were our inexperience coding in javascript because of this we had to do a lot of research on how react native uses js to code.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of setting up the whole frontend and being able to connect it to our backend successfully. We are also proud of ourselves for being able to fully use AWS s3 Bucket and getting everything setup.
## What we learned
Over the course of this project we have learned the most about react native and front and back end development we started off with a limited understanding of javascript and finished with a stronger base. We also learned how to use AWS servers and databases to store and share flies using unique userIDs that are saved locally to the machine you are using.
## What's next for NotAirDrop
Upgrading our serivce to be able to handle bigger files as well as videos to send
